    "In the previous notebook, I used linear regression to express our response variable as a linear function of the explanatory variable. For the case where the response variable is categorical, logistic regression provides a more natural modeling framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will specifically focus on the case of a binary-valued (e.g., 0 or 1) respose variable. In logistic regression, instead of expressing the response variable directly as a function of the explanatory variable, we express the probability of the response variable being equal to 1 (or 0) as a function of the explanatory variable. Specifically, the mapping is obtained by applying the standard logistic function to linear combination of the explanatory variable.\n",
